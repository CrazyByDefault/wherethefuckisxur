      <div class="a-challenges">
        <h3>#1: Ouroborea</h3>
        <p>The first Ascendant Challenge is located in the Aphelion’s Rest Lost Sector. The entrance to this Lost Sector is at the bottom of the cliffs near Petra’s area in The Strand. Enter the Lost Sector, kill all the enemies then <em>pick up that card with the Smiley Face, call him over to your place</em> and smoke that space-crack. You can’t miss the space-smoke once you are all gassed up. </p>
        <h3>#2: Forfeit Shrine</h3>
        <p>The second Ascendant Challenge is in the Garden of Esila zone in the very southern tip of the Dreaming City map. Once you get to the Garden of Esila smoke that space-rock then look for the space-smoke to the Ascendant Realm floating off the edge of a cliff on the right side of the zone. </p>
        <h3>#3: Shattered Ruins</h3>
        <p>The third Ascendant Challenge is a motherfucker of a jumpy puzzle that of course was really easy for you because you are just so goddamn good. ANYWAY. Head to the Spine of Keres (head left from the Divalian Mists landing zone) and enter the Observatory. Go through the LEFT door then follow the road ALLLLLL the way around (it’s kind of a hike) until you see a bunch of cliffs out in the distance to the left. Twist up that space-doobie and toke it up. Once you are space-stoned you will see the space-smoke to the Ascendant Realm floating off of one of the cliffs. </p>
        <h3>#4: Keep of Honed Edges</h3>
        <p>The fourth Ascendant Challenge is in Rheasilvia in the Harbinger’s Seclude zone. Ride your really fast 150 Speed sparrow to the very northern part of the region until you get to a giant statue. Smoke up that space-shit then, while facing the statue, look to your right and over the balcony you will see platforms emerge that you can only see while high on those space-drugs. Jumpy-hop your way up and around then jump in that space-smoke. Apparently you can also reach the portal by dicking around and jumping on the statue and busting your balls to the top, but just do the goddamn jumps already. </p>
        <h3>#5: Agonarch Abyss</h3>
        <p>The fifth <em>DESCENDANT</em> Challenge is in the Divalian Mists region, literally right behind the landing zone in the Bay of Drowned Wishes Lost Sector. You can’t fucking miss it. Enter the cave, blaze up that space-crack, hug the wall and you will find the space-smoke about midway through the open area. </p>
        <h3>#6: Cimmerian Garrison</h3>
        <p>The sixth Ascendant Challenge is in the southern section of Rheasilvia in the Chamber of Starlight Lost Sector. Shoot up all the space-bastards then fire up that space-crack then that space-smoke will pop up on a ledge right above the Lost Sector space-chest. </p>
