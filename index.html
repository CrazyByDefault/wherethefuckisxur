          <h2>Xur's Hot Poop Buffet</h2>
          <p>Imagine that you are having a nightmare. In this nightmare you walk into a restaurant, and it's one of those all-you-can-eat buffet restaurants but the second you walk in you are overwhelmed by the smell of feces. As you look around you notice that there is nothing to eat on the buffet tables except bowls of hot steaming poop. The restaurant stinks to high hell and it takes everything you have in you to not barf. You turn and run but instead of going outside you end up in an infinitely long room full of endless rows of tables lined with metal chafing dishes and they are also full of poop, and they even have those little sterno cans to keep the poop inside pipping hot. Xur's there. He's walking up and down the rows of tables with a box of matches making sure the sternos stay lit. You hear him laugh each time he lights a match. SUDDENLY YOU WAKE UP! You are at home safe and sound in your bed, naked, laying next to your Grandma. She's also naked. You may have just banged her. You are still stuck in a nightmare! A nightmare within a nightmare. Just like the Freddy Kreuger movies. Grandma rolls over and she is wearing Xur's hooded cape and she says, "SPEAK TO ME." You wake up for real, startled, sweating. You pinch yourself. Grandma is nowhere to be found. Your clothes are on. You say to yourself, "Good Lord, what was <em>THAT</em> all about." And then you realize, "Oh yeah, I went to wherethefuckisxur.com earlier today and saw what Xur was selling this weekend."
